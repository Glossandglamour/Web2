    <h1>GlossandGlamour's Interactive Narrative Archive</h1>
    
    <p><i>Below you will find a collection of interactive narratives, in which the choices you make are continually reflected by the story.  Most but not all focus on adult content, with a particular emphasis on latex and bondage.  If you're intrigued by what you found here, or would just like to say hello, I'm always available on the Torean Discord which can be found here: <a href="https://discord.gg/Y9TPgZg">by clicking this link</a>.  Otherwise, enjoy purusing the selection here.</i></p>

    <h2>Lost in Laminate</h2>
    
    <p><i>Torei, a planet as reclusive as it is infamous, has opened itself to the galaxy.  Known for its cultural inclination towards bondage, slavery, and the glossy material known as laminate, travelers are cautioned to be wary while on the surface-- some say the allure of a collar can surprise even the strongest willed, but many others simply find themselves caught in a system seemingly designed to enslave.  And you just woke up in a Torean hotel, memory full of holes, without a credit to your name.</i></p>
     <p><i>Can you make it off planet?  Do you want to?</i></p>

    <h2>Laminate Calling</h2>
    
    <p><i>Created to celebrate the one year anniversary of Lost in Laminate's release, Laminate Calling is a potential sequel, with numerous improvements including player backgrounds, skills, perks, and an improved clothing system.  I am providing no guarantee that this will be the actual sequel, or that I will create a sequel at all, but enjoy this sneak peek at what the future could hold.</i></p>

    <h2>Steeldriver</h2>
    
  <p><i>This project is a wholly SFW story set in a universe of my own creation, with fantasy and roleplaying elements.  When I lose the muse for Lost in Laminate I find switching focuses can help, and over time this story has taken root.  Featuring advanced UI and quest system improvements, Steeldriver sees you playing as courier between a spirit of the Blackwood and the Violet Lady.  Includes the entire prologue and opening sequence.</i></p>

   <h2>A Very Cynful Christmas</h2>
  
  <p><i>Besides creating narrative fiction, I also have a long term roleplaying partner, and this short and self-contained story features characters we have developed over time.  While not exactly built for public release, I am posting it here because some folks are ravenous for *any* sort of content.  Set in the Mass Effect universe and with a focus on quarians and ponygirls, A Very Cynful Christmas has four different playable characters and a small selection of custom artwork.</i></p>
